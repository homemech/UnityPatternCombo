# unity-pattern-combo

An action/fighting game combo system centered on the command pattern. Created in December 2023 as a supplement for Unity e-book "Level up your code with game programming patterns"

This demo involves most of of the programming patterns in Unity's e-book:

## Getting Started:

Open **PatternComboDemo** in the UnityPatternCombo folder. 

**Note:** Given the arcade/action style of the project, it requires a **game controller**. That said, you can edit the SideFighterControls input actions in the **ComboScripts** folder if you would like to add keyboard buttons.
